"""Genome Assembly with Perfect Coverage.

Given: A collection of (error-free) DNA k-mers (kâ‰¤50) taken from the same strand of a circular chromosome. In this
dataset, all k-mers from this strand of the chromosome are present, and their de Bruijn graph consists of exactly one
simple cycle.

Return: A cyclic superstring of minimal length containing the reads (thus corresponding to a candidate cyclic
chromosome).
