"""Fixing an Inconsistent Character Set.

Given: An inconsistent character table C on at most 100 taxa.

Return: A submatrix of Câ€² representing a consistent character table on the same taxa and formed by deleting a single row
of C. (If multiple solutions exist, you may return any one.)

Sample input:
100001
000110
111000
100111

Sample output:
000110
100001
100111
