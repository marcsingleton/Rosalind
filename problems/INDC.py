"""Independent Segregation of Chromosomes.

Given: A positive integer n â‰¤5 0.

Return: An array A of length 2n in which A[k] represents the common logarithm of the probability that two diploid
siblings share at least k of their 2n chromosomes (we do not consider recombination for now).

Sample input:
5

Sample output:
0.000 -0.004 -0.024 -0.082 -0.206 -0.424 -0.765 -1.262 -1.969 -3.010
