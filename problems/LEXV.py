"""Ordering Strings of Varying Length Lexicographically.

Given: A permutation of at most 12 symbols defining an ordered alphabet ùíú and a positive integer n ( n‚â§ 4).

Return: All strings of length at most n formed from ùíú, ordered lexicographically. (Note: As in ‚ÄúEnumerating k-mers
Lexicographically‚Äù, alphabet order is based on the order in which the symbols are given.)
