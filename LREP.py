"""Finding the Longest Multiple Repeat

Given: A DNA string s (of length at most 20 kbp) with $ appended, a positive integer k, and a list of edges defining the
suffix tree of s. Each edge is represented by four components:

1. the label of its parent node in T(s);
2. the label of its child node in T(s);
3. the location of the substring t of sâˆ— assigned to the edge; and
4. the length of t.

Return: The longest substring of s that occurs at least k times in s. (If multiple solutions exist, you may return any
single solution.)
