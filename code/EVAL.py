"""Expected Number of Restriction Sites.

Given: A positive integer n (n â‰¤ 1,000,000), a DNA string s  of even length at most 10, and an array A  of length at
most 20, containing numbers between 0 and 1.

Return: An array B having the same length as A in which B[i] represents the expected number of times that s will appear
as a substring of a random DNA string t of length n, where t is formed with GC-content A[i].
